- Generally, derivatives of dependent functions do not update when function definition updates
  (also applies to use of f0, f1, etc)
    - Happens because derivatives are evaluated and optimized at parse time
    - Currently, have hack when updates derivatives used to find crit points
        - Slow, incomplete bc doesn't work for d/dx notation
    - Solution: keep definition dependency tree, update tree on definition change
- Sum/prod currently define the iterating variable, which is unexpected
  In a similar vein, plotter currently defines x,y,t which is not ideal
    - Cause: currently need to define variable (explicit off) for parser to parse without erroring
    - Solution: add 'relocate' mode in addition to explicit on/off where undefined variables added to 'parser relocation table' but not env
    - Solution: add temp variables stack in parser or similar solution
- Implement expression output display (if expression evals to constant AND is not an equation)
    - e.g. 3+3 should output 6 rather than draw line y=6
- Error should be associated with function, not at bottom of functions section

- UI
    - When deleting definition/using function for something else in GUI, function defined in env is not deleted
    - Need to integrate sliders into expression editor
    - Folders
    - GUI to add polygon, text, etc
    - Duplicate function
- Vector/matrix-based evaluation
- Implement Julia set
- Implement integrals
- Mobile keyboard
- Data I/O and data plotting
- Graph visualization
- Implement 3D plot
- Spcial handling for conic sections
- Basic equation solving before plot
- Improve polygon triangulation/fill quality
- Shell:
    - Add methods to manage functions (add function, update expression)
    - Ban changing definitions made in plotter from shell
    - Add if, while
    - Advanced CAS capabilities
