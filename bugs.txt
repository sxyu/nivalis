- Fix random crashes when making many mutual references (?)
- Generally, derivative does not update when function definition updates
    - Since derivatives are evaluated and optimized at parse time
    - Currently, have hack when updates derivatives used to find crit points
- When removing definition in GUI, function defined is not deleted
- Sum/prod currently modify the iterating variable, which is unexpected
- Need to implement expression output (if expression evals to constant)
- Error should be associated with function, not at bottom of screen

- Need to implement integral
- Implement fractals
- Implement 3D
- UI
    - Need to integrate sliders into expression editor
    - Need folders
